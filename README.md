### Lab Refections

* I liked this lab because it was a nice way to ease into `if...else statements` and see how logical operators are used. I decided as a way to help me remember/learn, I tried to see if I could type out the html structure format myself but got stuck so I search for an example online. I did the same when writing the statements and also when incorporating the `.toLowerCase();` in the code but ended up having to refer to the class notes.
* I think for me, some extra practice on assigning variables when writing statements and functions is going to be needed, especially since next week I get the feeling we will be diving into functions.
* I wasn't sure how long this lab was going to take me, it ended up going quicker than I thought it would be, I'm hoping that will be par for the course but likely not, lol
* How do you see yourself planning and evaluating your learning?

### Learning Journal 02

* As in above, I'm going to assess each class if there are things I still don't understand in the discussion or find myself getting stuck on as a way to guide me to what I need to spend some extra time on learning
* What details will you record and/or measure?
  * My plan is as I do or find ways to "test" myself, the amount of time it takes to solve a problem will be my gauge on how well I am learning or need to spend more time doing extra exercises
* How often will you evaluate what you want to learn?
  * I'm hoping it will be daily
