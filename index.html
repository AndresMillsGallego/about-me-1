    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h3>A little background...</h3>
    <p>Hello, my name is Angela and I'm a native Washingtonian. Which is a good fit for me since I love the rain and not a fan of hot weather... though, that may be changing due to climate change!</p>
    <h3>Education</h3>
    <p>I went to Eastern Washington University and graduated with a degree in Chemistry specializing in Forensic Science in 2006. Wow! That seems like such a long time ago.</p>
    <h3>Job Experience</h3>
    <p>Though I graduated with a Forensic Science degree, I ended up working in a lab as a Cytogenetic Technologist. If you didn't know what that was, don't worry, I didn't either until I started applying for jobs after graduation. If you're interested in learning more about it, click <a href="https://www.news-medical.net/life-sciences/What-is-Cytogenetics.aspx">here!<a></a></p>
    <p>I've actually have been working in the medical laboratory field for about 20 years now. I started out as a phlebotomist after graduating high school as a way to pay for school. I've realized recently that 20 years is a long time in an industry, and as much as I enjoy it, I think it may be time for a change... or at the least, a good excuse to go back to school and learn something completely foreign to me! Which is what brought me to Code Fellows. My goal is to complete 201, 301 and 401 and see what happens. Whatever it may be, the ultimate goal is to enjoy the journey.</p>
